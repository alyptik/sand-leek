# sand leek
## experimental vanity onion address whatchamacallit

Still early days.
Warning: this tool doesn't yet do sanity checking on the keys produced.
Use at your own risk and verify the keys' sanity yourself.

## Future work
I have every intention to add GPU capability to sand leek.

Additionally, as outlined above, sand leek really needs to be verifying
that keys are sane.

## Benchmarks
Preliminary benching shows sand leek to be faster than some of the other
similar tools out there when pushing work across cores.

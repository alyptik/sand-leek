# sand leek
experimental vanity onion address whatchamacallit

## Usage

Typical usage is something like

	sand-leek -s mycoolsite -t 4 > key.pem

to spawn 4 worker threads each looking for a key for an address starting
with 'mycoolsite'. It might find a private key for any of the addresses:

	mycoolsite5avt44.onion
	mycoolsiteane4hb.onion
	mycoolsitewtetnf.onion
	mycoolsiterkom5h.onion

or a large number of other valid addresses. Beware of using too long a
search. While you may luck out and get a key quickly, on average, it
may take a very long time to crack a long search.

## Future work
I have every intention to add GPU capability to sand leek.

Additionally, as outlined above, sand leek really needs to be verifying
that keys are sane.

## Benchmarks
Preliminary benching shows sand leek to be faster than some of the other
similar tools out there when pushing work across cores.

## Inspiration
sand leek was greatly inspired by schallot, escahlot and scallion.
